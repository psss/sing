\Song{i am so sad}
i am so sad
what shall i do
there is no bird
\hbox{not a \vtop{soul in this darkness
      nothing but darkness
      nobody knows
      \hbox{what a \vtop{fear do i fell
             how cruel silence seems
	     when there's not anybody
	     \hbox{who could \vtop{show me the way
	               out of the loneliness
		       where i have to stay
		       forever it seems
		       }
             }
	     }
	     }
	     }
      }


\song{hey hou}
hey hou, hey hou
to dishwashing we go
to wash the plates and cups and bowls
we go, we go \S

hey hou, hey hou
back to werk we go
to clean the pots and sweep the floor
we go, we go \s

hey hou, hey hou
to camp harlem we go
to see what's up what's going on
we go, we go, we go
